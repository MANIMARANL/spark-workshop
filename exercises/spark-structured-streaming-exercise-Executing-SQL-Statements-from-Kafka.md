# Exercise: Executing SQL Statements from Kafka

Develop a standalone Spark Structured Streaming application (using IntelliJ IDEA) that uses [DataStreamWriter.foreachBatch](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.DataStreamWriter) operation to execute SQL statements coming in as records from Apache Kafka, e.g.

```
SELECT * FROM t1
```

Use `sbt package` the application and `spark-submit` it.
